# Entity-Framework-E-Commerce
E-Commerce with well known database Northwind.

This is a WinForms app. I started developing it with ADO.NET. Then later on, I switched to Entity Framework. It's a dummy project for me to improve myself.

If you are interested in testing and running my project, you should have the Northwind database in your server. You can find the database here : https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs. You should also change the connection string accordingly.
